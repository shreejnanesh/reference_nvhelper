1Write a sed script to generate exit status

	Success Status (0)
	sed 's/\bdf\b/meow/g' random

	Invalid Syntax/Command/regEX/invalid extension (1)
	sed 's/df/meow' random #substitution syntax is invalid

	File Errors - cannot open/ file not found (2)
	#removing read permission for random (chmod -r random) and executing below command
	sed 's/df/meow/g' random 

	Errors like - IO error/processing error during runtime/SED aborting immediately (4)
	#Serious error: using -f with command line option provides exit status 4
	sed -f 's/df/meow/gi;dp' random

2. Self study: Explore how to generate custom exit status
	#command q or Q are used to send the custom exit status 
	sed 's/\bdf\b/meow/g;q100' random #exits without processing more commands, with custom exit status
	sed 's/\bdf\b/meow/g;Q120' random #exits without processing more commands also wont print anything in pattern buffer, with custom exit status
